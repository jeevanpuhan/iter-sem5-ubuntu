The Unix system if full duplex: The character
you type on the keyboard are sent to the system,
which sends them back to the terminal to be
printed on the screen.
Normally, this echo
process copies the characters directly to the
screen, so you can see what you are typing,
but some times, such as when you are typing a
secret password, the echo is turned of so the
characters do not appear on the screen
